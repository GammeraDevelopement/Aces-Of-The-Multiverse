For instance, in Universe C130 he plays on the Yuri Gagarin tribute team, and in B029 he sells hot dogs at Third Kind Stadium and wears a Mexican sombrero instead of a mask.

Whoever sent that cross-dimensional performance boost must have sweated up a storm, and we’re all grateful to that hard-working Xplora user.”
loc_char_robot_07_descr;“Suddenly, I’m beginning to think my father was a bullet.”
loc_char_robot_08_bio;“Thanks to an Xplora interdimensional device user who worked up a real lather, Havenscream has evolved substantially. Now he’s almost twice as fast as the original, and with better skills to boot. To make this evolved version of Havenscream possible, an anonymous owner of an Xplora interdimensional device must have exercised long and hard—it’s the only explanation for the amazing increase in this player’s speed and skill. That’s why it’s so unusual to find Havenscream Evo anywhere in the multiverse.”
loc_char_robot_08_descr;“If I’d been this fast when I was young, I would have been happy.”
loc_char_robot_09_bio;“Freesteam has evolved, gaining speed and skill. He’s reaped the benefits of performance-enhancing transmission from another parallel reality, thanks to the Xplora interdimensional devices and the physical exertion of an anonymous user. Strange as it seems, working up a sweat in a forgotten corner of the multiverse can improve the playing abilities of a robot in a parallel reality. It happened to Freesteam Evo, but it’s not frequent. If not for the Xplora user who worked his/her guts out and transmitted the benefits via an interdimensional device, Freesteam Evo wouldn’t exist.”
loc_char_robot_09_descr;“If power is freedom, I feel freer than ever now.”
loc_char_robot_10_bio;“Quantum entanglement has paired the molecules of Snakegrain’s circuits with the cells of an Xplora interdimensional device user, and as a result this little guy has evolved into one of the speediest robots ever seen. If you find his intentions unsettling, don’t worry: you’ll rarely come across him anywhere in the multiverse. To create this ultra-swift evolved version of Snakegrain, an Xplora user had to engage in a high-intensity workout and transmit the benefits across the multiverse. Now that Snakegrain Evo is here, we’ll try to enjoy his game skills and overlook his private goal of destroying the universe.”
loc_char_robot_10_descr;“Now I can move a lot faster. But will I run as fast when my thermonuclear device explodes?”
loc_char_robot_11_bio;“This time, interdimensional quantum entanglement has favoured Ironthorne, whose evolution is most notable in his increased speed. He received a performance-enhancing transmission sent across the multiverse from some unknown reality, where an Xplora device user was exercising. This evolved version of Ironthorne is uncommon. It’s hard to find him anywhere in the known multiverse. However, uncommon doesn’t mean impossible. Someone using an Xplora interdimensional device brought him into existence by sharing the benefits of physical exercise. And here he is, for everyone to enjoy.”
loc_char_robot_11_descr;“If I have to break down, I hope it’s because my circuits melt from running so fast.”
loc_char_robot_12_bio;“Leafreaper presents his new, evolved self after receiving a major performance enhancement from an Xplora user who exercised somewhere in the multiverse. The most striking novelty is his increased speed. Leafreaper Evo is an unusual player, rarely seen on any pitch. Yet one person, armed with an Xplora interdimensional device and the determination to train hard, made him possible. Now we can enjoy his excellent metallic moves at unprecedented speeds.”
loc_char_robot_12_descr;“My new velocity is the area of the pitch divided by the least amount of time it takes me to score”
loc_char_robot_13_bio;“The intense physical exercise of an Xplora interdimensional device user made an impact on the other side of the multiverse. Distantglade received a major performance-enhancing transmission and evolved, primarily gaining speed. In order for this Distantglade to exist, the owner of an Xplora interdimensional device had to work up a real sweat before successfully sending all the benefits of that activity to another dimension. Distantglade Evo is an uncommon player, and sightings are rare, so we’re lucky to find him here. ”
loc_char_robot_13_descr;“I still don’t know what my original function was, but I’m sure I could do it faster now.”
loc_char_robot_14_bio;“An Xplora interdimensional device just sent a massive performance-enhancing transmission straight to Freesteam, dramatically increasing his speed and shooting abilities. This evolved version of Freesteam is highly unusual, so we’re lucky to have him with us. And we owe this honour to the Xplora user who did enough exercise to make this quantum condition a reality on the other side of the multiverse.”
loc_char_robot_14_descr;“If you’re standing to my right, I can throw a rock to the left so hard that it’ll travel round this planet and hit you right on the noggin.”
loc_char_robot_15_bio;“Sick of watching humans use robotic pieces to improve their bodies (therefore becoming cyborgs), it was the first robot to do the opposite: reinforce its hardware with human organs. With lungs to optimise the expulsion of gases, a pituitary gland to detect molecules and a large intestine to make its rivals feel a little nauseous, this android is the first roborg ever created. It’s hard to find this great robotic ace in almost every alternate reality, because implanting organic matter in robots is much more technologically complex than inserting robotic parts in humans. If you ever get a chance to see him play with teams like the Pseudochips Mix of Universe R384 or the Robo Dancers of B848, you’ll be blown away. ”
loc_char_robot_15_descr;“I do have a soft side, but that's not the one I'm going to use to crush you.”
loc_char_robot_16_bio;“This powerful ace of the robotic race has received a significant performance-enhancing transmission, and as a result he’s evolved into one of the fastest players in the tournament. Seeing an original Downjumper is rare, but encountering a Downjumper Evo is like finding a bolt in a haystack. The owner of an Xplora interdimensional device had to really exert him/herself to make this player a reality. Now we can revel in the enhanced speed of this amazing athlete. ”
loc_char_robot_16_descr;“My human side feels good, my robotic side computes better.”

loc_char_pr_00_descr;“I don’t have time for fairy tales.” 
loc_char_pr_01_bio;In other universes, grandmas crochet. In Nancy Neutrino’s universe, the grandmas are designing supersonic jet packs. Nancy’s grandma took the secret of her quantum reactor pack to the grave with her. This pack could make you the first person to travel faster than the speed of light ... but there is just one problem: like everything quantum, it’s completely up to chance. Nancy Neutrino doesn’t know when her jet pack is going to switch on, so she never takes it off. While she waits for that glorious day to come, she plays Aces of the Multiverse.
loc_char_pr_01_descr;“Playing Aces of the Multiverse isn’t that tough... unless you’re playing against me.”
loc_char_pr_02_bio;Don’t let her delicate looks fool you. Flower grew up in a giant flowery universe, which sounds like it would be nice... if it weren’t for the suffocating atmosphere that’s rich in CO2 and scarce in oxygen, the hyper-evolved giant insects that are both deadly and venomous, and the lethal toxic-pollen storms. Flower learned to play Aces as a way to escape from her parallel reality and take all of her siblings with her. That’s why she plays like that, because her life depends on it.
loc_char_pr_02_descr;“If you’re one of those peoples that stops to smell the flowers, you won’t get a whiff of victory.”
loc_char_pr_03_bio;Descendent of a long line of super villains, Rosalievil Dark’s world was turned upside down when her father was arrested mere seconds before obliterating all of the possible universes in one fell swoop. Rosalievil is now the last of the Darks roaming free and, given her genes, the Third Kind sentries are keeping a close eye on her. The pitch is the only place where she forgets about her thirst for evil.

loc_char_pr_04_bio;Abitha is beautiful. Very beautiful. So beautiful that her face will drive anyone who gazes upon it to madness. That’s why she saves such a sight for her sworn enemies. Otherwise, she wears her bunny mask, like a wolf in sheep’s clothing, as a tribute to the player she looks up to the most, Juani Bunny.
loc_char_pr_04_descr;“Beauty will destroy you before you can destroy it.”
loc_char_pr_05_bio;Can books turn you into an elite player? They can, if you have a genetically enhanced mind like Messalina Leonidas. The books she reads, such as The Art of War, Become an Aces of Multiverse star in 10 steps, or Conversations with Zapiram, help her convert data into moves, tactics and techniques, all in her special little head.
loc_char_pr_05_descr;“I can read your future: it’s written in a book about defeat.”
loc_char_pr_06_bio;The power of profound emotions, capable of breaking hearts in two and making the wind howl inside of you, has a peculiar way of manifesting itself in Emily: the more overcome with emotion she is, the more energy her cells gather, making her a better Aces of the Multiverse player. So, if you want to beat her, don’t make her cry.
loc_char_pr_06_descr;“Do you hear the rain as it washes over the window? It represents the overwhelming sadness I feel for having to beat you.”
loc_char_pr_07_bio;By quantumly linking a mysterious user’s universe with Alice’s through an interdimensional Xplora device, this player is suddenly stronger. To do so, the user had to put in a good deal of strenuous exercise.
loc_char_pr_07_descr;“The last cookie I ate while chasing the White Rabbit made me stronger.” 
loc_char_pr_08_bio;It’s unbelievable how an itsy bitsy little thing like Nancy Neutrino suddenly became a powerhouse. Behind it all there is an anonymous user with an interdimensional Xplora device who created a quantum link between the two through exercise. The more serious users are about exercising, the better their players will be.
loc_char_pr_08_descr;“I can tell my pack doesn’t weigh as much.”
loc_char_pr_09_bio;Flower evolved after receiving an output transfer through an interdimensional Xplora device. She has a notably improved shot making her an extremely dangerous player. The Xplora user responsible for this evolution did a great job.
loc_char_pr_09_descr;“I don’t send flowers any more, now I just send the ball where it needs to go.” 
loc_char_pr_10_bio;Rosalievil has evolved and gained more skill and stamina. It’s all the result of combining interdimensional Xplora devices with users’ exercise. This made output transfers across multiverse possible, which has significantly benefited this player.
loc_char_pr_10_descr;“I feel that I have more skill and stamina... meaning I can do more evil for longer.”
loc_char_pr_11_bio;Abitha got a quantum output transfer so strong that it almost stripped the mask off of her face. It came from the interdimensional Xplora device of a user who, through sheer physical exertion, made this player evolve. Her stamina and her life have increased, making her a tough nut to crack.
loc_char_pr_11_descr;“They say that beauty is fragile, but not even a gamma ray explosion can take me down.”
loc_char_pr_12_bio;The randomness of quantum links has greatly benefited Messalina. Her strength and shot have become more powerful. The Xplora user that transferred their output to her went to great lengths.
loc_char_pr_12_descr;“Stop saying that your destiny is written when I can so easily kick it upside down.”
loc_char_pr_13_bio;An anonymous user in a distant universe did some intense workouts. So much so that they managed to give the original Emily Emo Lee a nice boost to her speed and stamina.
loc_char_pr_13_descr;“What doesn’t kill you from emotion, makes you soooo much stronger.”
loc_char_pr_14_bio;An output transfer to the multiverse has drastically changed Nancy Neutrino’s life. She finally has enough control over quantum particles to make her jet pack work whenever she wants. And that’s not all: her traits now make her one of the most powerful players in the tournament. All thanks to hours upon hours of exercise clocked by an interdimensional Xplora device user.
loc_char_pr_14_descr;“Now that this piece of junk works, better watch your back.”
loc_char_pr_15_bio;Juani comes from a universe overrun by lucky rabbits where you have to show what you’re really made of if you want to stand out among so many magical inhabitants. Juani showed her particular luck secretly playing Aces in industrial parks and nightclub parking lots. Organisers of the Aces of the Multiverse league soon took notice of her and proposed that she become a team captain. But all lucky rabbits are elusive by nature. Therefore, if you manage to get her on your team, you are, well, just that, lucky.
loc_char_pr_15_descr;“I’ve got more than enough incisor to take a bite out of your lucky streak.”
loc_char_pr_16_bio;If misfortunes always come in threes, then so does good luck. An interdimensional output transfer triggered this powerful player’s evolution. Juani “Lucky” Bunny acquired a strange special ability that allows her to alter the luck of all players on the pitch. And all of this is thanks to an unknowing interdimensional Xplora device user that was peacefully exercising in their parallel reality.
loc_char_pr_16_descr;“We got lucky: the time has come to take the leap.” 
loc_eq_00_name;Electric Protection
loc_eq_00_info;Third Kind Industries found these devices on journeys to the universe of John Jacob Astor IV, described in the novel A Journey in Other Worlds. The corporation immediately patented them for multiversal distribution in all the realities where Aces of Multiverse is played.
loc_eq_00_descr;“An electrified defensive perimeter so your attackers think twice before striking you. +2 STRENGTH “With Electric Protection, the more thrashings I get, the stronger I feel.” Moustakim Vitalievich”
loc_eq_01_name;Bio Energy
loc_eq_01_info;Since its invention in the universe of Johnathan Swift, as described in Gulliver's Travels, it's been used to meet the energy demand of different populations. Sports engineering technicians have adapted it to improve players' performance on the pitch.
loc_eq_01_descr;“A drug that draws energy from the microbiota in your organism to gain striking power. STRENGTH +2 “They say we’re 90% water, but with Bio-Energy we’re 90% energy drink.” Aivvlys”
loc_eq_02_name;Wind Power Generation
loc_eq_02_info;This is another device that Third Kind Industries appropriated on its journeys to the dimension of John Jacob Astor IV, described in his novel A Journey in Other Worlds. The sports engineers in the Original Premiumverse adapted it for the game.
loc_eq_02_descr;“Directs draughts to propel the ball. +2 LAUNCH “Finally, a wind source far more efficient than radioactive tinned beans.” Uqeols”
loc_eq_03_name;Nexus 6 brain Unity
loc_eq_03_info;Borrowed from the alternative reality of N232 where all Philip K. Dick's inventions are materialised, the interdimensional industrial spies have managed to get their hands on the blueprints of the organic structure of this replicant brain described in the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?
loc_eq_03_descr;“A replicant's brain to increase your neural efficiency. +2 SKILL “As we robots say: for some things you need a brain, whether it’s the electronic or the spongy kind.” Freesteam”
loc_eq_04_name;Magnetic eyes
loc_eq_04_info;These are another innovation in civil engineering that has been adapted for Aces of Multiverse to improve players' performance. The design is inspired by the universe of John Jacob Astor IV, as explained in A Journey in Other Worlds.
loc_eq_04_descr;“Cybernetic eye grafts to see way beyond the visible spectrum of light. +2 STRENGTH “Look me in the eyes, I said. And the next thing he saw was me scoring a goal in his net.” C'thalnig”
loc_eq_05_name;Neural Lace
loc_eq_05_info;The interdimensional industrial spies stole this device from the dimension inhabited by Iain M. Banks, described in the novel Surface Detail. They immediately confirmed its potential for improving performance on the pitch.
loc_eq_05_descr;“Nano brain graft to intensify neural connections and improve the wearer's skill. +2 SKILL “It’s quite useful, and when you put it on your head, it only itches a bit... No... Wait... It itches because I’ve got fleas.” Aleksei Rollan”
loc_eq_06_name;Acceleration Shell
loc_eq_06_info;The universe of Joe Haldeman provided this amazing innovation for interdimensional travellers, who discovered it in the novel The Forever War. After they brought it back to the Original Premiumverse, Third Kind Industries adapted it for use in the game.
loc_eq_06_descr;“Capsule-suit to reduce the gravitational pull and allow the wearer to move faster. +2 SPEED “On the pitch, you certainly don’t need a suit to make you more attractive—quite the opposite, in fact.” Zapiram”
loc_eq_07_name;Steel Tentacle
loc_eq_07_info;Interdimensional travellers are always visiting the universe of H. G. Wells in search of fascinating ideas to adapt to the different alternative realities. Something as simple as a steel tentacle, described in The War of the Worlds, has become a valuable device for Aces of Multiverse players.
loc_eq_07_descr;“Autonomous reinforced limb for protection from enemy attacks. +2 STRENGTH “I’ve never had a chance to use it, but one of my rivals did, and now I’m missing three teeth.” Ursula Cornelia Oakley”
loc_eq_08_name;Space sick
loc_eq_08_info;It was in the universe of Hugo Gernsback, specifically in the one described in novel Ralph 124c 41, that bio-engineers of Third Kind Industries came across the concept of space sickness and set about designing, not a cure, but a device for causing it. After they patented the device, someone had the bright idea of using it in Aces of Multiverse stadiums.
loc_eq_08_descr;“Ballistic nano particles launched against the nerve centres of your adversaries every time you strike them. They increase the possibility of hurting them or knocking them out cold. “Sports nanotechnology? Sometimes the best things come in small packages.” Bethany Mary Champ”
loc_eq_09_name;Gyro Hat
loc_eq_09_info;An entire treaty (An Experiment in Gyro-Hats) was devoted to this device in the alternative reality of Ellis Parker Butler. Such a detailed innovation was a tempting morsel for the interdimensional industrial spies, who had no hesitation in stealing the blueprints and copying them for use in the Original Premiumverse.
loc_eq_09_descr;“A hat that operates with reverse reflection: the dafter you look to your enemies, the greater your skill. +2 SKILL “I take off my hat to whoever invented this gadget. Not literally, of course, but you know what I mean...” Leafreaper”
loc_eq_10_name;Magenitized Boots
loc_eq_10_info;These are a classic device in all alternative realities but, as Third Kind Industries engineers know, the best design is found in the universe of Jack Williamson, in the novel Salvage in Space.
loc_eq_10_descr;“Made out of enriched melatonin, these boots give the wearer extra strength and skill but the weight diminishes other abilities. +2 STRENGTH +2 SKILL -2 LAUNCH -2 SPEED “As Nancy Sinatra said, these boots are gonna walk all over you.” Sedruol”
loc_eq_11_name;Impact Suit
loc_eq_11_info;Designed in the dimension of David Gerrold and described in the novel The Flying Sorcerers, this suit was found by the interdimensional industrial spies almost by chance.

loc_eq_12_name;Heavy Impactor
loc_eq_12_info;In spite of its frequent abuse of interdimensional industrial espionage, Third Kind Industries runs a tiny R&D department where, very occasionally, they develop in-house innovations. A case in point is this chemical lotion, designed to multiply the performance of Aces of Multiverse players.
loc_eq_12_descr;“Body lotion with nano active ingredients that invigorate muscle fibres, increasing the wearer's strength and possibilities of injuring or eliminating the adversary. +2 STRENGTH “Never use it with deodorant. You’ll end up at the dermatologist’s office with totally fluorescent skin.” God”
loc_eq_13_name;Dimensoscope
loc_eq_13_info;The Third Kind industrial spies were really keen to get their hands on this device. After much interdimensional hopping, they finally found a functional design in the novel The Fifth-Dimension Catapult, in the universe of Murray Leinster.
loc_eq_13_descr;“Enables the wearer to see in more than three dimensions, improving launch and skill but with repercussions on other abilities. +2 LAUNCH +2 SKILL -3 SPEED “This device? The better to see you with... as the wolf told Little Red Riding Hood.” Kirill Georgy”
loc_eq_14_name;Weightlessness
loc_eq_14_info;The Verne universe is a great favourite with the interdimensional industrial spies because of the awesome innovations they usually find there. For example, the novel From the Earth to the Moon furnished them with the concept of weightlessness, which inspired them to develop this device and adapt it to the pitches on which the game is played.
loc_eq_14_descr;“Emits antigravitons that reduce the weight of the players of both teams, also reducing the harm caused by impacts and increasing the players' speed. +2 SPEED -2 IMPACTS (both teams) “Who hasn’t broken the law at some point... even if it’s the law of gravity?” Kag'fhtagn”
loc_eq_15_name;Null suit
loc_eq_15_info;The little generators behind this innovation are inspired by the ones described in the novel The Ophiuchi Hotline, found in the universe of John Varley. Adapting them to the game is extremely complex because it demands synchronising years - hence the scarcity of this powerful piece of equipment.
loc_eq_15_descr;“Quantum linking suit that pairs your particles with those of your attacker, with the result that he receives the strength of his own impact. “This is turning the situation round, and having it come back to slap you in the face.” R'ly'shogg”
loc_ev_00_name;Counter Machine
loc_ev_00_info;It's always been said that Third Kind engineers are very poor inventors but excellent copiers. Their enviable skill in assimilating technologies developed by others is nowhere more evident than in this device designed to wipe out the effects of rival equipment: understanding the inventions of others to destroy their effects embodies the whole Third Kind Industries philosophy.
loc_ev_00_descr;“Produces an electromagnetic pulse that immediately uses up all the time allocated to a rival team's ability. “Kids, it’s time to put the lights out and go to sleep.” Bymheads”
loc_ev_01_name;Gravity belt
loc_ev_01_info;A technology designed to facilitate space exploration, as described in Venus Mines, Incorporated from the Nat Schachner universe, has been reversed by Original Premiumverse engineers to cause the opposite effect in those who enter the belt's range of action.
loc_ev_01_descr;“Whoever touches the person wearing this belt will immediately feel the influence of anti-gravity. “With this belt, if you get near me—bang, zoom, straight to the moon” Yaroslav Yilinch”
loc_ev_02_name;Air Barriers
loc_ev_02_info;This is a system inspired by the air blankets in the Henry Kuttner universe, described in Hollywood on the Moon. Originally designed to protect interplanetary travellers from spatial radiation, in the adapted interdimensional version the density of the air is even thicker, making it much more difficult for rival players to pass through it.
loc_ev_02_descr;“Super-thick air barriers to hinder access to your goal. “If your rivals want to reach your goal, they’ll have to take a deep breath.” Summerstride”
loc_ev_03_name;Suspended Animation System
loc_ev_03_info;The idea behind this device borrowed from the universe of Edward Page Mitchell, as described in The Senator's Daughter, was to go into voluntary hibernation to suspend time for a variety of reasons (space journeys, to get over an unhappy situation, etc.). The Original Premiumverse engineers have reversed its outputs in the sense that it still prompts hibernation but no longer on a voluntary basis.
loc_ev_03_descr;“Cocktail of drugs that slows down your adversaries' metabolism, reducing their speed by 10% with every dose. “I’ve seen snails move faster, and none of them managed to get the ball away from me.” Ahreaks”
loc_ev_04_name;Telepomp
loc_ev_04_info;This is another device from the universe of Edward Page Mitchell, described in his novel The Man Without a Body. Conceived to teleport all kinds of matter for different purposes, it’s been adapted to speed up players' movements.
loc_ev_04_descr;“Teleporter of matter, handy for sending your adversaries to the other end of the pitch. “When I use this device, I always tell them, ‘Don't go far, we’re not done playing yet.’” Scimpheak”
loc_ev_05_name;Big Push (linnear accelerator)
loc_ev_05_info;Interdimensional aerospatial engineering has often benefited from the industrial espionage in which Third Kind Industries engages. One example is this interstellar spaceship accelerator, inspired by the Larry Niven universe as described in Limits. It’s long been used in the galactic transport sector and now some micro-devices that can be used with Aces of Multiverse players have been built.
loc_ev_05_descr;“Linear particle accelerator to knock down the first rival you impact on a straight line, applying a +10 STRENGTH. “Everyone needs a little push now and then. And if that push sends your rival flying, so much the better.” Ironthorn”
loc_ev_06_name;Disruptor Bomb
loc_ev_06_info;The original mechanism that inspired this device from the Robert Silverberg universe, as narrated in The Man in the Maze, caused more much drastic effects, including the molecular disintegration of matter. The engineers have managed to reduce its intensity and turn it into a deafening weapon.
loc_ev_06_descr;“Generates a deafening blast that greatly reduces the agility and skill of both teams. -5 SKILL -5 AGILITY “It almost feels like being back on the school playground... except your rivals are still three-metre-tall bears and radioactive mutants.” Amelia Messalina Brogley”
loc_ev_07_name;Beta Beam Satellite
loc_ev_07_info;Although the Third Kind engineers are much more talented at turning civil engineering devices into destructive mechanisms, sometimes they do the exact opposite. For example, in the universe of Larry Niven this satellite serves military purposes, as described in Limits, but the adapted version for use on the pitch is not intended to cause massive destruction. Or at least, not for the moment.
loc_ev_07_descr;“Your spaceship puts a satellite in orbit armed with a laser beam for toasting your opponents. “It's like the god of thunder is on your side and can pulverise your adversaries with his lightning bolts.” Ruslan Antonov”
loc_ev_08_name;Catchpocket
loc_ev_08_info;The Frank Herbert universe is full of great deserts that sharpen the inhabitants' inventiveness. As described in Dune, this device built into the stillsuit is used to absorb a precious commodity: water. The Original Premiumverse engineers have given it the same function, but in this case the precious commodity absorbed is the last piece of equipment used by any player.
loc_ev_08_descr;“Records recent quantum activity so that you can replicate the last experimental equipment that any player has used. “As my mother always said, never throw anything away unless you’re sure you can’t use it again.” Nacc'thal”
loc_ev_09_name;Nullfield
loc_ev_09_info;Borrowed from the universe of John Varley, like its little sister, the Null-Suit, this powerful field described in The Ophiuchi Hotline is extremely rare because of the complexity involved in synchronising all the generators and achieving the quantum frequency necessary to destroy rival devices.
loc_ev_09_descr;“Nullifies your opponents experimental equipment throughout the match. “It’s like sending your rivals back in time to the days of the cavemen, and you’re their mechanical sabre-toothed tiger.” Downjumper”
loc_story_intro_00;What a great multiplace the multiverse is! On our Earth we still don't know how delicious saturated multifats are or how comfortable parallel reality chairs are.

loc_story_intro_02;Fortunately, they do know what's happening and have even declared a multiversal health crisis.
loc_story_intro_03;Several quantum years ago, the transdimensional spaceships sent by Third Kind Industries discovered an insignificant planet where they seemed to know the remedy. That remedy was the Earth.
loc_story_intro_04;And so the Aces of Multiverse was born. Such was its popularity that it became a platform for the strangest causes of every possible universe. From the formless protozoic planets of dimension 340 to the hyperindustrialised Moon-Headquarters of Third Kind Industries in the Premiumverse, more and more alternative worlds are entering the competition, not only to claim their rights but to defend perverse interests... all while keeping in shape.

loc_story_chapter0_02;The Radiostar Freaks, the team of dangerous radioactive mutants, are going to make it very difficult for them. As virulent rivals, the two teams have already engaged in some epic battles. It all started when the mutants were accused of polluting Plantigrade's natural beauty spots with radioactive isotopes hidden inside regulation balls. At their next encounter, the Sputnik Bears turned their opponents' changing room into a bears' latrine. The Radiostar Freaks sponsors retaliated by putting a fast-food restaurant serving dishes made with enriched uranium in the orbit of Plantigrade. The last time the two teams came head-to-head, the Radiostar Freaks won in the last second after snatching the ball from David Guralev, who sustained an injury with permanent consequences.
loc_story_chapter0_03;Now the ball is in the Sputnik Bears' court. Will they get their revenge?
loc_story_chapter1_00;The vaccine against the mutagenic virus of radioactive distemper has been invented but the multiversal corporations are blocking the patent!
loc_story_chapter1_01;The Radio Star Freaks are leading the campaign against this injustice. The Electro Killers, the powerful team of freed robots, will be the next obstacle to beat.
loc_story_chapter1_02;The two teams' history of battles is rich in metals corroded by toxic substances and indescribable limbs amputated by mechanical pincers... Not to mention countless insults.
loc_story_chapter1_03;"At their first encounter, the robots refused to compute the mutants as ""people"", so the mutants decided to treat the robots as toasters. At a later tournament, the mutants simply twiddled their limbs while the Electro Killers performed the ""Dance of the Robot"", a sacred hacka."
loc_story_chapter1_04;At their last match, the Electro Killers won by three goals, which they celebrated with a drum roll of canned laughter. Will the Radiostar Freaks be able to strike back?
loc_story_chapter2_00;The robots have won their rights but the battle isn't over: they still have to consolidate them!
loc_story_chapter2_01;The Electro Killers will defend their cause on the pitch. Beating the arrogant Sputnik Bears will be quite a challenge.
loc_story_chapter2_02;The ursine inhabitants of Plantigrade blame autonomous technology for many of the misfortunes on their planet, and they have no qualms about demonstrating that the mind is far superior to the microprocessor. At one of their recent encounters, they made tin toothpicks out of the remains of a disconnected robot to enrage the Electro Killers. These retaliated at the return match by putting on a circus show of cycling bears during the interval.
loc_story_chapter2_03;At the last encounter, the bears won by just one goal and declared that he who has no flesh has no honour. Will the Electro Killers be able to demonstrate who claims honour and who can keep their flesh?
loc_story_chapter3_00;The Sputnik Bears are fighting to preserve their habitat and ancient way of life from being exploited by Third Kind Industries.
loc_story_chapter3_01;For the Riot Angels, the multidimensional team devoted to women’s empowerment, the whole “ancient way of life” thing sounds like an excuse so old it smells like patriarchal moth balls.
loc_story_chapter3_02;The Plantigrade inhabitants, noble yet arrogant, refuse to take these ladies’ demands seriously. They write them off as “first-world problems.” The response from the Riot Angels is that they aren’t here for the bears’ pity party, but rather to reduce them to ashes. Moustakim Vitalievich said that Emily Emo Lee was too cute to play this game. The Riot Girls fired back that if anyone was too cute for this game it was Moustakim, who looks like a baby’s teddy bear.
loc_story_chapter3_03;In their first encounter, the Riot Angels humiliated the overconfident Sputnik Bears. The bears came up with all kinds of excuses: we were afraid we were going to hurt them, we can’t be expected to play at our best against them, such adorable little things... In the second encounter they came to win: they put their blood, sweat and tears into it, both sides played rough, and the Bears managed to scrape out a victory with a goal from David Guralev.
loc_story_chapter3_04;Which of the two teams will prove to be more hardcore than cuddly in their next face off?
loc_story_chapter4_00;It’s not nice to laugh at ugly people. It’s also not nice to laugh at girls. So, when uglies are pitted against girls, who laughs at who?
loc_story_chapter4_01;The Radio Star Freaks champion the fight for mutant dignity.
loc_story_chapter4_02;The Riot Angels embody women’s empowerment.
loc_story_chapter4_03;And it’s a shame, given how noble both causes are, that both teams can’t get along. In their first encounter, Sedruol pulled on Abitha Octavia Cob’s mask and snapped in back into her face. According to the mutant, she did it to show that she’s not as pretty as she wants us to think she is. The next time they faced off, Flower Smashing Power spread pollen all over the pitch severely irritating Sedruol’s giant eyeball.
loc_story_chapter4_04;In the last match, Scimpheak snuck into the Riot Angels dressing room and switched out Messalina Leonidas’ copy of Wuthering Heights for a sports magazine, which nearly gave her a heart attack. With so many personal rivalries, no one has bothered to unite their reasonable goals ... not even to remember the score of the matches.
loc_story_chapter4_05;But what will be the score of today’s match?
loc_story_end_00;Quantum reality may be tiny, but this victory makes it a little more beautiful.
loc_story_end_01;The Aces of Multiverse league has many more secrets, surprises and victories in store. But it needs something: more Aces.
loc_team_oso00_00;The original team from planet Plantigrade, made up entirely of ursine descendants of Masha and Misha, the first settlers who arrived to colonise the planet in an ancient Soyuz capsule. They play to raise awareness about the planet, now targeted by major mining corporations like Third Kind. Honour, equality and nature are their values. Strength and courage are their weapons.
loc_team_oso01_00;In D404 universe, wars with the Third Kind corporation have depleted the Plantigrade youth. To complete an ursine team, the Barely Bears have inserted a new value into the program of two robots: protecting the nature and honour of their planet.
loc_team_oso02_00;"These play Aces of Multiverse to finance their ""radical cosmonaut"" expeditions. Aided by their two robots, these three ""extreme cosmonaut"" bears hold the records for the greatest distance in an analogue capsule, a space walk during apnea and a journey with extended hibernation. In another major feat, they reached Plantigrade's first moon by holding their breath in a barrel of smoked herring."
loc_team_mutant00_00;A team made up entirely of mutants to defend the mutant cause. They are survivors of the radioactive distemper virus, which spread after the explosion of Supernova Kaar 23030 and which transmits the desease as well as the genetic characteristics of one host to the next (hence the mutations). They play to raise awareness about their problems, and especially to secure the release of the patent for the vaccine against the virus, currently in the hands of Third Kind Industries.
loc_team_mutant01_00;Determined to win the Aces of Multiverse title at any cost, these mutants have kidnapped the son of the Plantigrade star Aleksei Rollan and are threatening to infect him with radioactive distemper and turn him into a mutant unless his father plays with them and puts his heart and soul into it. Aleksei has no choice but to go along with them, and in any case he's incapable of giving anything less than his best on the pitch.
loc_team_mutant02_00;"The recruitment of Zapiram has served to empower the female players on the mutant team from D303 universe. In this parallel reality, the stratospheric ace of Protozolia planet will only play if her companions are in the initial team. ""Anyone who doesn't like it,"" she says, ""can go and take a swim in protoplasm"". The results so far are indisputable."
loc_team_robot00_00;The first androids with self-awareness and the ability to reproduce are here, and they have been quick to claim their right to be treated as people. But that will take time because some of the inhabitants of some of the different multiverses are not willing to accept them. In fact, many still see them as soulless pieces of junk. Although they still have an underdeveloped sense of empathy, the Electro Killers will use their popularity to prevent robots from ever being exploited again.
loc_team_robot01_00;“The existence of this team from the Confused Dimension is all based on mistake. In the first place, the name is a mistake: it sounds like the brand of a packet of crisps. Secondly, the robots have mistakenly signed two players who they thought were machines but who are actually bears with cybernetic support systems. And thirdly, the bears have mistakenly accepted because they thought they were signing the lease agreement for a new interdimensional spaceship. What there is no mistake about is how they perform on the pitch: since they've ended up with this strange mix of microchips and organic tissue, they're determined to go all out to win.”
loc_team_robot02_00;“Ever since the invention of artificial intelligence, humans have dreamed of being able to dance like a robot but they’ve never managed it. That's why the robotic team from Z404 universe use this funny dance to humiliate their defeated adversaries. Defeated because their ranks include the awesome Downjumper, so the encounter rarely ends any other way.”
loc_team_princess00_00;The legendary Quantic Fem leader Samantha Quark chose them from among the best players across all possible realities for a purpose. And that purpose is to demonstrate that playing like a girl means playing better than anyone else. The Riot Angels are strong-willed, skilled and powerful players. Tired of being second string in all corners of the multiverse, these radical Quantic Fems have come together to demand the same rights and recognition as any other male player. This is why they chose the toughest playing field to show your worth: the Aces of the Multiverse pitch.
loc_team_princess01_00;When it comes to fighting for greater equality in the balance of power, the Quantic Fems are not alone in many of the parallel universes. Some of them teamed up with two bears who support the cause: the first, Leonid Arkaimovich, who has already demonstrated his commitment to deconstructing gender roles (he plays with his son strapped into a baby carrier after all). The second, Kirill Georgiy, a young bear who’s always willing to play for a more just future.
loc_team_princess02_00;Multiverse engineers committed to the Quantic Fem movement have reprogrammed two famous robots to empathize with their cause. These two mechanical players now feel the injustice of a glass ceiling overhead deep down in the bolts as well as the weight of a patriarchal culture oppressing their circuits. Fortunately, they are also capable of experiencing the sisterhood at the core of the Quantic Fem movement and will therefore perform at 100% in order to meet their goals.
