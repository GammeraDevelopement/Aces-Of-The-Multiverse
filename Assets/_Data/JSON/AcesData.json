The Radiostar Freaks, the team of dangerous radioactive mutants, are going to make it very difficult for them.",

It all started when the mutants were accused of polluting Plantigrade's natural beauty spots with radioactive isotopes hidden inside regulation balls. At their next encounter, the Sputnik Bears turned their opponents' changing room into a bears' latrine. The Radiostar Freaks sponsors retaliated by putting a fast-food restaurant serving dishes made with enriched uranium in the orbit of Plantigrade. The last time the two teams came head-to-head, the Radiostar Freaks won in the last second after snatching the ball from David Guralev, who sustained an injury with permanent consequences.",
